<h1> Chase's Biography </h1>
<body>
    <h2>My name is Chase McDowell</h2>
        <p> I am a senior at Franklin Central High School. I am currently working in the Nextech Catapult 
        program. I have two cats, Spooky and Bandit. They are my weakness because they can get me to do almost anything for them.
          </p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p> Some things that I feel describe me best personally would be that I tend to be pretty open minded to new and different things.
    I feel that I am honest more often than not, lies I do tell tend to not hurt anyone just banter. Along with this, I do feel that 
    I am talented in the technology field. 
</p>
<h2>My Experience</h2>
Although my experience in coding is little to none, only Visual Basic, I am very passionate about it as I have wanted to do coding 
even from a young age, I just never knew how to start. I am slow to start, but will pick up very fast once I can get a grasp on the 
basics. I hope to learn much more in the upcoming weeks.
