    <h1> About Me </h1> 

      
    <h2>My name is Chase McDowell</h2>
        <p> I am a senior at Franklin Central High School. I am currently working in the Nextech Catapult 
        program. I have two cats, Spooky and Bandit. They are my weakness because they can get me to do almost anything for them.
          </p>
<p> Some things that I feel describe me best personally would be that I tend to be pretty open minded to new and different things.
    I feel that I am honest more often than not, lies I do tell tend to not hurt anyone just banter. Along with this, I do feel that 
    I am talented in the technology field. 
</p>
<p> Although my experience in coding is little to none, only Visual Basic, I am very passionate about it as I have wanted to do coding 
even from a young age, I just never knew how to start. I am slow to start, but will pick up very fast once I can get a grasp on the 
basics. I hope to learn much more in the upcoming weeks.</p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>

    <p> I am a gamer all the way. Personally, I am not sure if i would be able to get by without games. Many people find
        video games to be a waste of time or to be a problem with behavior. Although I will not say that it is not changing for 
        some people, I personally play video games to relieve stress or to simply take my mind off things. Another hobby of 
        mine is reading. I enjoy grabbing a book, preferably fantasy/sci-fi, and knocking it out within a week. My favorite 
        book/series woould be the Nick Chronicles. Along with this, I also enjoy programming software (or trying to anyway)
        because it gives me the feeling of accomplishment knowing that I had made this.
